# Simple Contacts

A simple contacts management app built using Django.

This was essentially a self-study project for me to learn about handling user-uploaded images at the backend (user profile images in this case).

I wanted to restrict the size of user profile images to speed up page-loading, and I also wanted to control the dimensions of images so as to have more control over the look of the page.  For these reasons I wanted to dynamically crop and resize images without the user having to specify an anchor point for the image cropping.  For this I initially opted to use the django-imagekit library and its SmartResize processor class which automatically selects the most interesting section of an image based on the entropy of the image (Iâ€™m not sure how it does this but it works quite well).

However, this using django-imagekit led to an issue regarding the backend storage (an AWS S3 bucket in this case) being accessed a very large number of times to see whether particular images file exist, and my free tier privileges consequently disappearing fairly quickly.

Rather than opting for the more complex solution of setting up cache to avoid the above problem, I instead opted for the simpler approach of just using Pillow (a fairly standard imaging library) to do the image cropping and resizing myself.  Currently, user-uploaded images are dynamically cropped by finding the largest square in the centre of the image and then resizing this to 200 x 200 pixels. This method seemed sufficient for my needs.

The django-cleanup app is also used to remove any images from the S3 bucket if they are no longer required.
